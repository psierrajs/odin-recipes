    <h1>Vegan Carrot Soup</h1>

    <img src="../img/vegan_carrot_soup.jpeg" width="400">

    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p> Chicken Parmesan is no doubt the most popular non-pasta dish in Italian-American style restaurants. And while this delicious meal may seem fancy, it's actually pretty easy to make at home.</p>

    <p>This is a vegan spin on a Bavarian carrot soup. It is very delicious and I have even seen it made with other vegetables, like beets, as the star of the dish. Try it out and experiment with other vegetables. I have even substituted the celery with an extra carrot and a teaspoon of celery seed and it worked out great. The recipe listed is my favorite and it is a great go-to for vegans. Enjoy!</p>
    
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

    <ul>
        
        <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1 large onion, diced</li>
        <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>4 large carrots, sliced</li>
        <li>5 new potatoes, quartered</li>
        <li>2 cups vegetable broth</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons grated fresh ginger</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon curry powder</li>
        <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>

    </ul>
    
    <h3>Steps</h3>

    <ol>

        <li>Heat oil in a soup pot over medium heat. Add onion and garlic, and cook stirring often until onion is translucent. Add carrots and potatoes, and cook for just a few minutes to allow the carrots to sweat out some of their juices.</li>
        <li>Pour the vegetable broth into the pot, and season with ginger, curry powder, salt and pepper. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to low. Simmer for 15 to 20 minutes, until carrots are tender.</li>
        <li>Puree soup in small batches using a food processor or blender, or if you have an immersion blender, it can be done in the soup pot. Reheat soup if necessary, and serve.</li>
        
    </ol>
